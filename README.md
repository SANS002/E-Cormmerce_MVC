**BookShoppingCartMvc (A basic e-comm system for beginners)📚🛒**
It is a source code of the youtube tutorial on Build a Full E-commerce Application Using .NET Core 9, SQL Server, MVC | Complete Tutorial. Initially it was designed to explain how shopping cart 🛒 works in dot net core mvc. But now it has more features except payment gateway. A ⭐ in repository is highly appreciated, helps to promote my content.

📢 Initially , this project was built with .net 7. But it is Upgraded to .net 9.0. now and I will try to keep it up to date.
